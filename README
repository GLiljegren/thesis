** Packages included **

The liuthesis package includes a number of packages for convenient,
contemporary TeX typesetting. When using the XeTeX engine for
typesetting your manuscript, the polyglossia, mathspec, fontspec,
xunicode and xltxtra packages are loaded. All manuscript files should
be written with UTF-8 encoding. When PDFLaTeX is used as the
typsetting engine, the babel, palatino and mathpazo packages are used
instead.

The BibLaTeX package is used for managing references. Currently, there
is no way to specify the load-time options to biblatex as document
class options together with other options, so the biblatex package _has
to be loaded manually_ in settings.tex (see Usage below).

** Usage **

This package contains a style file for theses (liuthesis.cls) and a file
settings.tex which must at least include the lines

\usepackage{biblatex}
\addbibresource{<my bibliography file>}

and possibly other settings. In the directory figures/, you should
place all graphics for your thesis. Logos are included for LiTH,
please add other logotypes as appropriate.

In your thesis file, you need to specify where the bibliography
should be typeset using the command \printbibliography. demothesis.tex
provides an example of how this works.

Abstract.tex is a mandatory file with your abstract, other files can
be included at will from your main thesis file.

** Including articles **

\includearticle{<citekey>}

With this command, you can include pdf articles and refer to them in
your thesis. demothesis.tex provides an example of this. <citekey>
should be the same as the key in your bibliography which describes
your article, and the file name of the pdf file. You can refer to your
articles in your thesis using the reference key "art:<citekey>".

\includearticletex{<citekey>}

With this command, you can include TeX articles and refer to them in your
thesis. demothesis.tex provides an example of this. <citekey> should
be the same as the key in your bibliography which describes your
article, and the file name of the TeX manuscipt in the papers/
directory. Please refer to the scigen.tex example for hints how you
format your manuscript for inclusion. You can refer to your articles
in your thesis using the reference key "art:<citekey>".

There are a number of commands with one parameter which should be used
to specify thesis metadata, and they are all typeset using the command
names as they appear in the PDF. For instance, using the command
\opponent{Your opponent}, you can specify the opponent. If you do not,
the pdf will contain the verbatim text "\opponent" on all locations
where the argument supplied to that command will substitute
"\opponent".

** File headers **

To use and update the file headers appropriately, you will need Emacs
with the header2 package. Put this information in an Emacs init file:

(require 'package)
;; Marmalade
(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("marmalade" . "http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/"))

;; The original ELPA archive still has some useful
;; stuff.
 (add-to-list 'package-archives
              '("elpa" . "http://tromey.com/elpa/"))
(package-initialize)

(autoload 'auto-update-file-header "header2")
(add-hook 'write-file-hooks 'auto-update-file-header)
(add-hook 'latex-mode-hook   'auto-make-header)
